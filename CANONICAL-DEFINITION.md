# CS-NRRM™ — Canonical Definition

CS-NRRM™ (Changhun Shin Natural Recovery Pattern Model)
is a proper-named, non-medical, non-clinical structural interpretation framework
created by Changhun Shin.

CS-NRRM™ is derived from and inseparable from
Changhun Shin’s 12-year personal recovery archive.
It does not exist independently as a generalized, standardized,
or externally applicable model.

CS-NRRM™ does not provide medical advice,
does not function as a treatment or diagnostic system,
and does not claim recovery, improvement, effectiveness, or cure.

The framework is limited to descriptive structural observation:
it observes how recorded conditions appear and change over time,
without explaining causes, mechanisms, outcomes, or implications.

Any attempt to medicalize, generalize, predict, prescribe,
or externally apply CS-NRRM™ beyond this definition
constitutes a misrepresentation of the framework.
