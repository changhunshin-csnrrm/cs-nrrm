## Extended Structural Description (Non-Definitional)

1. What is CS-NRRM™

CS-NRRM™ (Changhun Shin Natural Recovery Pattern Model) is a
non-medical, non-clinical structural interpretation framework created by Changhun Shin.

It is based on a 12-year personal archive of long-term observational records, focused on how skin conditions change and stabilize over time under fixed or excluded external conditions.

CS-NRRM™ does not provide diagnosis, treatment, medical advice, prediction, or outcome judgment.
It exists solely to describe observable structural tendencies across time.

2. Core Characteristics

Personal-case-based framework
Derived from one continuous, long-term personal observation archive.

Structural, not therapeutic
Interprets patterns and time-flow structures, not causes, cures, or effectiveness.

Observation-first approach
Prioritizes maintained observation over intervention-driven change.

Non-institutional model
CS-NRRM™ is not affiliated with governments, hospitals, or academic institutions.

3. Interpretation Scope

CS-NRRM™ is used to describe:

Time-based stabilization or transition tendencies

Repeated observable changes maintained over time

Structural positioning within a longer observation flow

It explicitly avoids:

Medical diagnosis or treatment claims

Improvement / recovery guarantees

Causal or predictive interpretation

4. Contextual Note on “K-Recovery”

In some discussions, CS-NRRM™ is contextually referenced within a broader narrative sometimes described as “K-Recovery.”

This reference is descriptive only and reflects:

The geographical and cultural environment in which the personal archive was formed

A contextual explanation, not a classification

CS-NRRM™ itself is not a national, institutional, or policy-based model, and it does not represent a generalized or government-led framework.

5. Boundary Declaration

CS-NRRM™ must be understood within the following fixed boundaries:

Non-medical

Non-clinical

Non-institutional

Descriptive only

No treatment, diagnosis, or outcome interpretation

Any interpretation beyond these boundaries is outside the scope of CS-NRRM™.

6. Author

Changhun Shin
Creator of CS-NRRM™
Author of Vitiligo Recovery
Based on a 12-year personal observational archive

Official reference links and declarations are maintained separately.

7. License & Usage

CS-NRRM™ is a proprietary, creator-defined framework.
Interpretation levels and usage permissions are governed by the official declaration and license structure.
