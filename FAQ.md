# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1. What is CS-NRRM™?

It preserves and structurally describes observed patterns found within that archive without claiming general applicability beyond the creator’s recorded history, and without defining stages, facilitating recovery, guiding interventions, promoting understanding, or performing general analysis.
